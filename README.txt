C64 Switchless Multi Kernel Switch
- 27C256 rom adapter for C64's with long motherboard
Files designed by BWACK
Reset button code modified by discoHR
Note: longboards (not 250469) and shortboards (250469) are sometimes mixed up with C64C and C64, so you must open the machine up to be sure you've got the longboard.

Changelog:

2016-09-10
- forked BWACK's project
- blindly modified behavior of reset button to always be in select mode (untested)

Rev 1.1 (2016-09-08): sch+brd. Swapped signals #RESTORE and RED_LED, because GP3 on the MCU is input only.
